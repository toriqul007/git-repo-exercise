# devops-example-repo
An example of how that start the setup of a repo following some branching rules

### Are you a new developer?

* We have separte folders for html, css, images and js. Respect this!
* If you have a set of images that belong to consider creating in sub folder in images for them.
* For now - we only develop the frontend part of the code. Later on we will move all files into a frontend folder if we add our own backend.

### Code standards
Make sure to follow our code standards and our directions how to setup the preferences for code formatting VSC. See our Intranet!

### Features / user stories
* As a user I want to see a nice greeting on the start page, so that I feel welcome.
* As a user I want to be able to navigate between pages using a main menu displayed at the top of each page.
